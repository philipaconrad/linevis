LineVis
========

A web utility that shows you the text in a file with a simple black-and-
white image. Just drag and drop files to generate images.

Black pixels = text.
White pixels = whitespace or filler.

Images generated with LineVis can be downloaded by right-clicking on the 
image, then choosing "Save Image As".



### Stuff I used to build LineVis
